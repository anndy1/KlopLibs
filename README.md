# KlopLibs

Hello everyone! My name is Andrew, and my nickname is Klop. I chose this nickname for Ebay long long time ago because of the convenient placement of the buttons on my keyboard. Some people say it means "a bed bug" in Russian. However, I don't care about it.

Here I'm going to place some of my libs for my convenience for my "Smart Home" things. May be someone will find them useful too.
